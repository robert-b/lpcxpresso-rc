/* font_6X8.FV' as include

 the array starts with a 8 byte header:
 1st Byte: 'F' first 2 bytes are always FV
 2nd Byte: 'V' for FONT VERTICAL
 3rd Byte: First code to define
 4th Byte: Last  code to define
 5th Byte: Width of character in dots
 6th Byte: Height of character in dots
 7th Byte: Height of character in bytes
 8th Byte: Bytes needed for each character (1..255)
            or 0 for big fonts calculate WidthInDots * HeightInBytes
  After that font data will follow */
